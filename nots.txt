Programing World2 comments
An inventory management system is the combination of technology (hardware and software) and processes and procedures that oversee the monitoring and maintenance of stocked products, whether those products are company assets, raw materials and supplies, or finished products ready to be sent to vendors or end consumers. A complete inventory management system consists of:
Improved cash flow
Better reporting and forecasting capabilities
Reduction in storage costs (overhead)
Reduced labor costs
Reduction in dead stock
Better organization
Enhanced transparency
Improved supplier, vendor, and partner relationships
Challenges of Inventory Management Systems
Having too much slow-moving inventory in stock, taking up valuable storage space and eating into the company’s bottom line.
Unexpectedly running out of stock of an essential inventory item, which can delay the supply chain due to backorders.
Inaccurate records (wrong part numbers, incorrect inventory counts) that arise from manual documentation errors.
Wasted man hours spent tracking down items that are stored in the wrong locations. Inventory storage that’s not optimized for efficiency (due to poor warehouse or stock room layouts) can also increase stock picking time, which also increases labor costs.
Best Practices for Inventory Management Systems
Location names
Easy-to-read location labels
Unique item identification numbers
Units of measure
A starting count
